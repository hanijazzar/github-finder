we dispatch an action to a reducer
action can be the response of an api call
the data gets updated in the backend

reducer:
is a function
takes in an action, 
handles updating the sate and passes the sate down to the components



Hooks
use state and lifecycle methods in a functojnal component
useState : have state within a functional component
useEffect: mimic component lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount. this is where u do the api calls
useContext
useReducer
reducer is a function which u can dispatch actions to in order to manipulate your app level state, then it sends down the state to the components
useRef used for react refs and working with form submissions

Context (resource can be github for example in our app)
resourceContext.js : initialize context for our resource
ResourceState.js : save the state and perform actions such as API calls. this becomes a provider where other components can call methods/actions ehre
resourceReducer.js : pass the new state to the components that use that updated state
